# Phase 1 — Dictation Intent Routing (DIR-01)

**Last updated:** 2026-04-25 (HS-1-06 built-in stages shipped — intent-router + kb-enricher).

## Goal

Deliver DIR-01 per `docs/PLAN_PHASE_DICTATION_INTENT_ROUTING.md`: a
real-time, on-device transcript enrichment pipeline for the voice-typing
path. The pipeline runs an LLM-driven intent router behind a pluggable
`LLMRuntime` Protocol — DIR-01 ships two concrete backends (`mlx-lm`
with `Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit` as the reference-Mac primary, and
`llama-cpp-python` with `Qwen2.5-3B-Q4_K_M` as the cross-platform
default), with constrained-decoding behind a shared schema compiler
(GBNF on `llama_cpp`, `outlines`-style on `mlx`). A KB-driven enrichment
stage follows. Off by default; opt-in per user config. This section is
**immutable** for the life of the phase.

## Scope

- **In:** Everything declared in scope by `docs/PLAN_PHASE_DICTATION_INTENT_ROUTING.md` §3.1. Implemented via stories `HS-1-02` through `HS-1-09` and `HS-1-11` (HS-1-01 and HS-1-10 dropped per the 2026-04-25 amendment). Phase exit is gated by the spec's §14 "Definition of Done".
- **Out:** Everything declared out-of-scope by `docs/PLAN_PHASE_DICTATION_INTENT_ROUTING.md` §3.2 — notably MLX-LM as a second on-device backend, cloud router fallback, web block editor, multi-utterance state, and shared model file with `intel.py`.

## Exit criteria (evidence required)

- [ ] All §9 `DIR-*` requirements have passing verification per the matrix in §10.2.
- [ ] Evidence bundle at `docs/evidence/phase-dir-01/<YYYYMMDD-HHMM>/` contains every file listed in spec §11.2.
- [ ] `dictation.pipeline.enabled = true` end-to-end run on the reference Mac with the `mlx` Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit primary works and feels responsive in real use. The `llama_cpp` Qwen2.5-3B-Q4_K_M path also runs end-to-end.
- [ ] With `dictation.pipeline.enabled = false`, typing behavior is byte-identical to pre-DIR-01.
- [ ] `holdspeak doctor` cleanly reports new checks (`LLM runtime`, `Structured-output compilation`) in both enabled and disabled states, for the active backend.
- [ ] Phase summary lists known gaps and explicitly defers DIR-02 items.

## Story status

Mapping: each story corresponds to one spec §12 step. Stories are
created ahead of time as `backlog` so the work is visible; only the
"in-progress" story has a fully fleshed-out file at any given time.

## Where we are

Spec amended (2026-04-25) to ship two backends (`mlx-lm` +
`llama-cpp-python`) behind a pluggable `LLMRuntime` Protocol with
`Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit` as the reference-Mac primary. All pre-shipping
measurement is dropped — DIR-01 banks on the chosen models and goes
straight to implementation. `HS-1-01` (baseline) and `HS-1-10`
(benchmarks) are dropped.

**HS-1-06 done.** Built-in stages landed in
`holdspeak/plugins/dictation/builtin/{intent_router,kb_enricher}.py`.
`IntentRouter` (`requires_llm=True`) builds a prompt from the loaded
blocks, calls the constrained-decoded runtime, coerces the dict into
an `IntentTag`, and never raises — on parse failure / unknown block id
/ runtime exception, retries `classify()` exactly once and falls back
to `IntentTag(matched=False, confidence=0.0)` (DIR-F-004); empty
blocks short-circuit without calling the runtime.
`KbEnricher` (`requires_llm=False`, no runtime arg per DIR-R-004) is
pure template substitution: gates on `matched=True` + `confidence >=
threshold` (per-block or default — DIR-F-006), resolves `{a.b.c}`
placeholders against an utterance + intent.extras context using a
custom resolver (no `str.format`), and skips injection entirely with
a warning when any placeholder is unresolved (DIR-F-007). 29-case
unit suite passes; full regression: 877 passed, 1 pre-existing
hardware-only `tests/e2e/test_metal.py` fail (Whisper model load),
unrelated. Next: **HS-1-07** (controller wiring).

## Active risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation | Stop signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llama-cpp-python` Metal wheel not installed → CPU-only inference when `llama_cpp` backend is active | medium | Doctor check inspects GPU offload; remediation hint surfaces immediately | First user report of slow `llama_cpp` path |
| `mlx-lm` import failure on `auto` resolution silently falls back to `llama_cpp` and surprises the user | low | `auto` resolution path reported by `DIR-DOC-001`; explicit backend choice never falls back | Any user reports unexpected backend |
| Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit RAM footprint (~5 GB resident) + `intel.py` Mistral-7B (~6 GB) OOM a 16 GB machine | medium | §3.2 #5 (no shared instance); doctor warns when both runtimes are warm-on-start on <16 GB | First user report of OOM |
| Constraint compile failure (GBNF or `outlines`) from a malformed `blocks.yaml` | low | DIR-DOC-002 + config-load-time validation in `grammars.py` for the active backend | Any compile exception in CI |
| Pipeline feels sluggish in real use on the `mlx` primary | medium | No numeric gate; if surfaced, default falls back to `llama_cpp` Qwen2.5-3B and the decision log is amended at that time | First user report of perception lag |
| Dual stack (`mlx-lm` + `llama-cpp-python`) bloats install / cold-start | low | Extras-gated install (`[dictation-mlx]`, `[dictation-llama]`); doctor reports which extras are present | Install size complaints in user feedback |

## Decisions made (this phase)

- 2026-04-25 — Pipeline off by default (`dictation.pipeline.enabled = false`). Opt-in via config — owner: agent.
- 2026-04-25 — **Pluggable LLM runtime: DIR-01 ships two backends.** `mlx-lm` (Apple Silicon native) and `llama-cpp-python` (cross-platform GGUF) behind a single `LLMRuntime` Protocol; selected by `dictation.runtime.backend: auto | mlx | llama_cpp` (default `auto`). **Supersedes the prior single-backend decision** — owner: agent + user (user: "abstracting away the execution interface ... implementing both").
- 2026-04-25 — **`mlx` primary model: `Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit`** (`Qwen/Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit`). Reference-Mac default. **Supersedes the prior "Qwen2.5-only" decision** — owner: user.
- 2026-04-25 — `llama_cpp` default model retained: `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` (`bartowski/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-GGUF`). Tiers: 1.5B / 3B / 7B — owner: agent.
- 2026-04-25 — Constrained decoding split per backend: GBNF for `llama_cpp`, `outlines`-style logits-processor for `mlx`. Both compiled from the same `BlockSet` by `grammars.py`. **Supersedes the prior "GBNF-only, outlines rejected" decision** — owner: agent + user (`outlines` accepted as a localized dep on the `mlx` path; churn risk contained to `runtime_mlx.py`).
- 2026-04-25 — **No pre-shipping measurement.** All baseline benches, validation spikes, and pre-ship benchmark gates are removed from DIR-01. The phase banks on `Qwen3-8B-MLX-4bit` (and the `llama_cpp` Qwen2.5-3B fallback) and ships on perception alone. **Drops HS-1-01 and HS-1-10.** **Supersedes the prior "validation via abstraction + HS-1-10 measurement" decision** — owner: user (explicit instruction: "I don't need a freakin' bench, we bank on qwen3-8b-mlx-4bit").

## Decisions deferred

- Cloud LLM router fallback — trigger: enough users want zero-local-model setup — default: never (HoldSpeak is local-first).
- Additional on-device backends beyond `mlx` and `llama_cpp` (vLLM, ollama, etc.) — trigger: measured advantage on the reference fixture — default: never.
- Web-based block editor — trigger: ≥3 user reports that file editing is the friction — default: CLI + file editing only.
- Shared model instance between `intel.py` and the dictation runtime — trigger: real OOM reports on common hardware — default: keep separate.
